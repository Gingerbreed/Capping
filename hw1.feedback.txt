Ok team,

- There was no project plan. The assignment clearly says "project plan: a
  detailed semester plan that includes activities, deliverables, etc., that
  your team will do, and it will also specify the activities of each individual
  and their responsibilities;". What you submitted is not a plan.  -10pts

- The user requirements need more details, it is too generic. Good user
  requirements lead to good use cases, and to good use case diagrams.  -4pts

- Use cases are poorly done. There are way too few of them. Furthermore, It
  seems like the use cases are not defined. Use case diagram lacks description
  of use cases. Thus, incomplete. Have you ever done this before? You should
  have asked.  -5pts

- There were no questions for customer attached whatsoever.  -10pts

- You really need to start taking this project seriously guys. You need to ask
  questions and make progress. This is a terrible start! You can do better than
  this. Whenever you have questions please ask. I'm happy to help you succeed
